## Bugs
Note: You need to open the website, wait for 5 minutes and then Refresh the website application, 
as this project is hosted in Heroku free dyno version, It shows an error page because this
free Dyno Heroku version sleeps the applications,so you need to wait for 5 minutes, 
this is to wait until the Heroku Dyno starts, I thing the solutions is to pay a Hobby Heroku version.
